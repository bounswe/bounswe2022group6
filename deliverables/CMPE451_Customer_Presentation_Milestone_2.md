# CMPE451 Customer Presentation Milestone 2

# Group Milestone Review

## Executive Summary

### Summary of the Project Status

Right after customer milestone 1, we started planning on what should be done until the customer milestone 2. After the first weekly meeting, we decided to implement the following features for the customer milestone 2:
* Profile Edit
* Profile Deletion
* Create Post and Comment
* Vote Post and Comment
* Search Post Using Label and/or Keyword

We selected these features based on the current status of our project and the capabilities and availabilities of our team members. After the decision was made, we quickly began implementing the features listed above.

We have successfully implemented the features listed for the customer milestone 2 and also included an additional basic chatbot as well. After the implementation, we worked on what we will be presenting in the demo and discussed what kind of scenarios we should use for presenting the work. When the discussions on the demo and the status of the project, we held a successful and smooth presentation in which we displayed all the features listed above to the customers.

### Changes Made for Improvement Since Milestone 1

We have observed that our inter-team communication could be better, so we started using swifter ways of communicating, like instant messaging. This has led to better awareness of what has been done, what is being done, and what will be done outside of the subteams for each of our members. It also enabled us to take into consideration of the design and implementation needs of the other parts of the project.

Additionally, we had decided to redistribute some of the work that has been blocking the other parts of the project so that the development could accelerate. This enabled us to resolve the congestions better that we faced during the implementation phase.

### Improvements Planned for the Remainder of the Project

Now that the most essential and core parts of the project are out of the way, we are planning on implementing the following features:
* Semantic Search for Posts
* Annotations
* Chatbot Improvements
* Messaging
* Notifications

With the features above, the project will be in a status where it satisfies every category of requirements specified in the CmpE 352. Our goal for the next customer milestone is to at least be able to show a basic version of each major feature mentioned or listed in the requirements specification document. In addition, if time permits, we are hoping that we can make improvements to the features implemented and polish the overall application.

## Progress Based on Teamwork

### Status of the deliverables of Milestone 1


### Progress according to requirements


### API Endpoints


### User Interface / User Experience


* Frontend 


* Mobile


### Annotations

Unfortunately, in our current status, our application does not support annotations yet. However, we have made plans and laid the groundwork for implementing the support for annotations. These include the following:

* Creating a seperate database to store the annotations.
* Making design decisions of when should annotations be returned as a reponse.
* Researching on what technologies we can use to implement annotation support. (like recoginto, annotorius, etc.)
* Having a deeper, more concrete understanding of what annotations are and why they are used.
* Examining the W3C standard.

Even though we have not implemented a support for annotations, we are ready to do it quickly. It is one of the first features that we planned to implement after the Customer Milestone 2.

## **Member:** Berfin Şimşek, Group 6 - Frontend.

### **Responsibilities:**

My main responsibility was implementing the necessary functions and integrating backend endpoints to the profile page of the user. I integrated GET and POST methods of the profile page so that user can see her account information and edit them if necessary. Also I changed the design of the page so that if the user is a doctor, she should form another form for vericifation by giving diploma ID and profession. I added a message to indicate the user whether verification process is completed or not. 

Additionally, I was responsible of the page's general design and compatilibity with other pages in terms of styling.

I modified the messages that appear after an operation such as "Login successful" so that they disappear 3 seconds after showing the message.

I also updated the project plan with Aral according to work done by each member.

## **Main contributions:**

- Integrated backend endpoints for getting a user's account information
- Integrated backend endpoints for editting a user's account information
- Designed the profile page
- Added a form to profile page for doctor verification
- Updated project plan
