# CMPE451 Customer Presentation Milestone 2

# Group Milestone Review

## Executive Summary

### Summary of the Project Status

Right after customer milestone 1, we started planning on what should be done until the customer milestone 2. After the first weekly meeting, we decided to implement the following features for the customer milestone 2:
* Profile Edit
* Profile Deletion
* Create Post and Comment
* Vote Post and Comment
* Search Post Using Label and/or Keyword

We selected these features based on the current status of our project and the capabilities and availabilities of our team members. After the decision was made, we quickly began implementing the features listed above.

We have successfully implemented the features listed for the customer milestone 2 and also included an additional basic chatbot as well. After the implementation, we worked on what we will be presenting in the demo and discussed what kind of scenarios we should use for presenting the work. When the discussions on the demo and the status of the project, we held a successful and smooth presentation in which we displayed all the features listed above to the customers.

### Changes Made for Improvement Since Milestone 1

We have observed that our inter-team communication could be better, so we started using swifter ways of communicating, like instant messaging. This has led to better awareness of what has been done, what is being done, and what will be done outside of the subteams for each of our members. It also enabled us to take into consideration of the design and implementation needs of the other parts of the project.

Additionally, we had decided to redistribute some of the work that has been blocking the other parts of the project so that the development could accelerate. This enabled us to resolve the congestions better that we faced during the implementation phase.

### Improvements Planned for the Remainder of the Project

Now that the most essential and core parts of the project are out of the way, we are planning on implementing the following features:
* Semantic Search for Posts
* Annotations
* Chatbot Improvements
* Messaging
* Notifications

With the features above, the project will be in a status where it satisfies every category of requirements specified in the CmpE 352. Our goal for the next customer milestone is to at least be able to show a basic version of each major feature mentioned or listed in the requirements specification document. In addition, if time permits, we are hoping that we can make improvements to the features implemented and polish the overall application.

### Annotations

Unfortunately, in our current status, our application does not support annotations yet. However, we have made plans and laid the groundwork for implementing the support for annotations. These include the following:

* Creating a seperate database to store the annotations.
* Making design decisions of when should annotations be returned as a reponse.
* Researching on what technologies we can use to implement annotation support. (like recoginto, annotorius, etc.)
* Having a deeper, more concrete understanding of what annotations are and why they are used.
* Examining the W3C standard.

Even though we have not implemented a support for annotations, we are ready to do it quickly. It is one of the first features that we planned to implement after the Customer Milestone 2.

### Standards

For the W3C standard, we have laid out the groundwork to support annotations and are planning on implementing the support for it right after the customer milestone 2.

For the ontology, we have implemented the label structure in a way that the relational structure in a medical ontology (we are considering National Library of Medicine) can be transferred to the application. This means that the support for ontologies is ready, and we are planning on improving our search endpoint to include semantic search.

## **Member:** Hakan Balık, Group 6 - Frontend

### **Responsibilities:**

Similar to the previous Milestone, on the frontend side I either created or reviewed almost **all of the functionalies**. I was highly involved with establishing the communication with the customer and between the subteams throughout the project. With consulting the team members I decided on which features to be implemented for Milestone 2. Apart from those I can say that my biggest impact for this Milestone was to create an extraordinary structure from scratch for landing page which also included the register and login pages on a carousel structure, on top of that I created the Medishare logo. I also created the Milestone 2 presentation outline with Bedirhan and contributed by triggering some functionalities during the presentation. Except frontend, I also gave some small ideas, reviewed the code and tracked the progresses of both mobile and backend teams. You can view the rest of my responsibilities from below.

### Unit Tests

I have spent like 6 to 8 hours just to create simple unit tests but non of the libraries I tried (Jest, React-testing-library and react-dom/test-utils) responded well for our project. That's why even though I spared a considerable amount of time, there is currently no unit tests that I created in the project.

### Additional Information

I think I have contributed to management part excessively, so it would be great to consider this aspect while reviewing individual efforts as well.

## **Member:** Aral Dörtoğul, Group 6 - Mobile.

### **Responsibilities:**

As a member of the mobile team, I was mainly responsible for developing the mobile app to meet the goals that we have set until Milestone 2.

In the general group meetings and the mobile team's meetings, we have tried to divide our total work evenly and I was assigned to implement the home feed and post/user searching mechanism of MediShare. Moreover, I have added the logo of MediShare and a feature to theme our components to create a consistent look in our mobile app. To comply with the coding conventions, I have added .env (dotenv) support for the app, which stores the hardcoded API URL's and other secret keys in a private file. Before Milestone 2, I have connected the app to backend following the standards of RESTful API.

Last but not least, I have updated the project plan with Berfin.

## **Main contributions:**

- Designing a logo for the app with Hakan.
- Implementing home feed for mobile that shows post previews.
- Implementing post preview component.
- Expanding the navigation structure of the app and connecting post details, chatbot, search, create new post pages to home feed.
- Implementing themes for consistency in UI (for mobile)
- Implementing post searching with keywords and/or filters (labels only)
- Adding .env support for mobile
- Connecting post search and home feed to backend
- Updating project plan
- Presenting Milestone 2 to the customer (with Bedirhan).

## **Member:** [Yusuf Erdem Nacar](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group6/wiki/Yusuf-Erdem-Nacar), Group 6 - Backend.

### **Responsibilities:**

As a member of the backend subteam, I was mainly responsible for developing the support for the functionalities and database model classes for the core parts of the project such as posts, comments, labels, accounts and search.

In detail, I was tasked with laying the groundwork for the support for the content related functionalities. This includes creating model classes for the contents, posts, comments and labels. In addition to preparing the mentioned model classes, I also implemented a few helper endpoints for our mobile and frontend team, such as an endpoint for fetching all posts and an endpoint for fetchin all labels in the system. Apart from these, I also implemented a basci search endpoint where users can search through the posts in the system by providing keywords and/or labels. Additionally, I also implemented the endpoints related to editing and viewing an account on the system.
Apart from these code related responsibilities, I also created API documentations for each and ever one of the endpoints I developed in order to help mobiğle and frontend subteams in their development.
In addition to these major responsibilities, I reviewed a significant amount of code for the backend part of the project as well as fixing bugs with the request of mobile and frontend subteams.

## **Main contributions:**

* Implementing view and edit account functionalities
* Creating model classes for the content, post, comment and label classes
* Implementing an endpoint for fetching all posts
* Implementing an enpoint for fetching all labels
* Implementing an endpoint for searching posts
* Reviewing and testing a significant amount of code
* Fixing numerous bugs
* Creating API documentations for the endpoints I implemented

## **Member:** Berfin Şimşek, Group 6 - Frontend.

### **Responsibilities:**

My main responsibility was implementing the necessary functions and integrating backend endpoints to the profile page of the user. I integrated GET and POST methods of the profile page so that user can see her account information and edit them if necessary. Also I changed the design of the page so that if the user is a doctor, she should form another form for vericifation by giving diploma ID and profession. I added a message to indicate the user whether verification process is completed or not. 

Additionally, I was responsible of the page's general design and compatilibity with other pages in terms of styling.

I modified the messages that appear after an operation such as "Login successful" so that they disappear 3 seconds after showing the message.

I also updated the project plan with Aral according to work done by each member.

## **Main contributions:**

- Integrated backend endpoints for getting a user's account information
- Integrated backend endpoints for editting a user's account information
- Designed the profile page
- Added a form to profile page for doctor verification
- Updated project plan
