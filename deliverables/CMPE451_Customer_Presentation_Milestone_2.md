## **Member:** [Yusuf Erdem Nacar](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group6/wiki/Yusuf-Erdem-Nacar), Group 6 - Backend.

### **Responsibilities:**

As a member of the backend subteam, I was mainly responsible for developing the support for the functionalities and database model classes for the core parts of the project such as posts, comments, labels, accounts and search.

In detail, I was tasked with laying the groundwork for the support for the content related functionalities. This includes creating model classes for the contents, posts, comments and labels. In addition to preparing the mentioned model classes, I also implemented a few helper endpoints for our mobile and frontend team, such as an endpoint for fetching all posts and an endpoint for fetchin all labels in the system. Apart from these, I also implemented a basci search endpoint where users can search through the posts in the system by providing keywords and/or labels. Additionally, I also implemented the endpoints related to editing and viewing an account on the system.
Apart from these code related responsibilities, I also created API documentations for each and ever one of the endpoints I developed in order to help mobiğle and frontend subteams in their development.
In addition to these major responsibilities, I reviewed a significant amount of code for the backend part of the project as well as fixing bugs with the request of mobile and frontend subteams.

## **Main contributions:**

* Implementing view and edit account functionalities
* Creating model classes for the content, post, comment and label classes
* Implementing an endpoint for fetching all posts
* Implementing an enpoint for fetching all labels
* Implementing an endpoint for searching posts
* Reviewing and testing a significant amount of code
* Fixing numerous bugs
* Creating API documentations for the endpoints I implemented
