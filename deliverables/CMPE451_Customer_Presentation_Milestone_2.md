# CMPE451 Customer Presentation Milestone 2

# Group Milestone Review

## Executive Summary

### Summary of the Project Status

Right after customer milestone 1, we started planning on what should be done until the customer milestone 2. After the first weekly meeting, we decided to implement the following features for the customer milestone 2:
* Profile Edit
* Profile Deletion
* Create Post and Comment
* Vote Post and Comment
* Search Post Using Label and/or Keyword

We selected these features based on the current status of our project and the capabilities and availabilities of our team members. After the decision was made, we quickly began implementing the features listed above.

We have successfully implemented the features listed for the customer milestone 2 and also included an additional basic chatbot as well. After the implementation, we worked on what we will be presenting in the demo and discussed what kind of scenarios we should use for presenting the work. When the discussions on the demo and the status of the project, we held a successful and smooth presentation in which we diplayed all the features listed above to the customers.

### Changes Made for Improvement Since Milestone 1

We have observed that our inter-team communication could be better, so we started using swifter ways of communicating, like instant messaging. This has led to better awareness of what has been done, what is being done, and what will be done outside of the subteams for each of our members. It also enabled us to take in to consideration of the design and implementation needs of the other parts of the project.

Additionally, we decided to redistribute some of the work that has been blocking the other parts of the project so that the development can start accelerating. This enabled us to better resolve the congestions that we faced during the implementation phase.

### Improvements Planned for the Remainder of the Project

Now that the most essential and core parts of the project are out of the way, we are planning on implementing the following features:
* Semantic Search for Posts
* Annotations
* Chatbot Improvements
* Messaging
* Notifications

With the features above, the project will be in a status where it satisfies every category of requirements specified in the CmpE 352. Our goal for the next customer milestone is to at least be able to show a basic version of each major feature mentioned or listed in the requirements specification document. In addition, if time permits, we are hoping that we can make improvements to the features implemented and polish the overall application.
