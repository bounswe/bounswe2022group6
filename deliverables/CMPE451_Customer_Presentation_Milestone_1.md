    **Member:**
    
    I am working as a UI/UX developer in the Mobile team of Group 6.

    **Responsibilities:**

    Last semester, we have worked on preparing the requirements for our project Medishare. Before diving into the implementation, my group and I have reviewed the requirements and updated them according to the new customer's demands. We have also reviewed the mockups and scenarios so that they are in line with the requirements. Then, we have divided the group into three teams: Mobile, Frontend, and Backend, and I assigned myself to the mobile team.
    
    As a mobile developer, I was responsible for initializing the mobile application and implementing the most fundamental features until this milestone with my team. First of all, we have researched about the popular frameworks that are used in mobile development, and decided to use React Native for this purpose. I have not worked with React Native before, so it took a while for me to set up my working environment and get used to developing with this new framework.

    For this milestone, I have implemented the main navigation of the mobile application, the user profile page, and a page for editing the user profile. Moreover, I have supported my team in the deployment of the application.

    Last but not least, I have updated the project plan with Berfin, which is important in terms of the overall project management.

    I am working as a Frontend developer in the Frontend team of Group 6.

    **Responsibilities:**

   As a team, we started the new term by revising our wiki page and requirements. I updated and edited README.md, deliverables and meeting notes in the first week. After cleaning up our wiki, we spent some time on requirements. I reviewed "voting a post" and "Interactions Between the Users and the Comments" requirements with İrem.
   
   After dividing into subgroups as Mobile, Backend and Frontend, I decided to be on the frontend team. I was responsible for creating a profile and a register page. Since I was not familiar with React.js, I spent some time on practicing it. After looking some example pages, I have created profile and register page for our app.
   
   Finally, I have updated the project plan with Aral according to our new arrangements.

   * **Member:** My name is Hakan Balık and I am a frontend developer in frontend sub-team of Group 6.
   * **Responsibilities:** I have been involved with most of the tasks either by owning or reviewing. I believe my most important contribution was to finalize the M2 deliverable last semester. For this semester, I have taken active role on onboarding the new customer. I also led the task where we decided on the project name and color palette. Apart from that I focused on delivering the frontend functionalities decided for Milestone 1 and taken role on every aspect except for Dockerization. Apart from those I took meeting notes, did a lot of research and reviewed the Requirements with my team. I will also be taking notes during the Demo presentation.
