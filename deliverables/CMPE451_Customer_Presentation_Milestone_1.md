* [Artun Akdoğan](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group6/wiki/Artun-Akdo%C4%9Fan)

    **Member:**
    My name is [Artun Akdoğan](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group6/wiki/Artun-Akdo%C4%9Fan), and I am working as a Developer in the "Backend Team" of Group 6.

    **Responsibilities:**

    We started this semester by reviewing last semester's already-prepared requirements. I suggested and changed parts of the account management requirements to make them more precise and correct. Also, I was able to plan the Backend subteam's communication plan and initialize the communication channel via Discord.

    As a backend developer, I was responsible for initializing the application and implementing the basic API for the first milestone described in the requirements. I have taken an active role in containerizing both Backend and Frontend via Docker, finding the most suitable database for our project, and unifying them in a relevant, robust and secure manner via Docker Compose. I also took an active role in the Deployment of the pre-release on the AWS EC2 instance. Besides, I have created the profile view API and user registration API. Apart from those work, I was constantly dealing with bugs that are either caused by backend frameworks, or by Deployment.

    Last but not least, I was able to fix some deployment bugs on the Amazon instance and deploy the milestone demo. Also, I updated the project plan according to my work.
   
    **Main Contributions:** 
  
    * **Brief list of responsibilities that are contributed by me:**
  
      * Researching on technologies to use in Backend development.
      * Deciding on the roadmap of Backend Development via meetings and requirements review.
      * Creating Application workspace folders for Backend, Frontend, and Mobile subteams.
      * Initializing Backend workspace via Django and with MySQL database.
      * Deploying the application via docker compose on AWS EC2 instance.
      * Containerizing both Backend and Frontend applications via Docker.
      * Implementing the Account View function.
      * Implementing the User Registration feature.
      * Documenting API's via Postman.
      * Fixing bugs that are related to Backend or Deployment.

* [Ali Kaan Biber](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group6/wiki/Ali-Kaan-Biber)

     **Member:** I am working as a frontend developer in the frontend team of group 6.

    **Responsibilities:**

    We started this semester with analyzing our requirements and introducing our project to our new team member. I reviewed and made changes
    to some of the requirements if necessary. After we decided to use ReactJS for frontend development, I made some research and spent some time learning it since I had no prior experience with it.

    My most important task in the frontend team was to integrate the register endpoint to our backend which was the first endpoint integration. I got CORS errors when I send requests to backend and also fixed it. After considerable amount of time I finished the integration and provide an overlay for my team members to follow for endpoint calls to integrate later on in the project.

    Apart from these I took some meeting notes and participated the dockerization and deployment meeting.

    I am part of the mobile sub-team of the Group 6.

    **Responsibilities:**

   As a team we reviewed whats necessary for new customers point of view and updated necessary stuff. Moreover, decided on the name of the platform. I personally checked some requirements with Alp Eren and we collaborated.
    
    I made research about mobile app development and asked my seniors about advantages and disadvantages of certain frameworks. While choosing our programming language and framework we deeply cared about the reflection of the tools that we use on the sector as we want to make insvestment for after graduation.
     
    For this milestone, I have not contributed significantly to the codebase as I was not familiar with both React Native and mobile app development so I had to study 
    in order to be ready for making contributions for the following milestones and tasks. Despite this I took part in the meetings while developing the app and reviewed pull requests.

    I am working as a UI/UX developer in the Mobile team of Group 6.

    **Responsibilities:**

    Last semester, we have worked on preparing the requirements for our project Medishare. Before diving into the implementation, my group and I have reviewed the requirements and updated them according to the new customer's demands. We have also reviewed the mockups and scenarios so that they are in line with the requirements. Then, we have divided the group into three teams: Mobile, Frontend, and Backend, and I assigned myself to the mobile team.
    
    As a mobile developer, I was responsible for initializing the mobile application and implementing the most fundamental features until this milestone with my team. First of all, we have researched about the popular frameworks that are used in mobile development, and decided to use React Native for this purpose. I have not worked with React Native before, so it took a while for me to set up my working environment and get used to developing with this new framework.

    For this milestone, I have implemented the main navigation of the mobile application, the user profile page, and a page for editing the user profile. Moreover, I have supported my team in the deployment of the application.

    Last but not least, I have updated the project plan with Berfin, which is important in terms of the overall project management.

**Yusuf Erdem Nacar - Group 6 - Backend**

***01.11.2022***

## Responsibilities
I am a part of the backend subteam of group 6 and most of my responsibilities are related to the backend side of the app. However, like everybody else, I also had other responsibilites related to the general management of the project. Thus, I will list them in separate subsections.

Please note that I will list the responsibilities in the importance order.

### General Management Responsibilities
1. Reviewing the requirement subsections
   1.  [1.1.1.1](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group6/wiki/D2:-Requirements#1111-creating-an-account)
   2.  [1.1.1.2](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group6/wiki/D2:-Requirements#1112-adding-information-to-a-account)
   3.  [1.1.1.3](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group6/wiki/D2:-Requirements#1113-editing-the-information-in-an-account)
   4.  [1.1.1.4](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group6/wiki/D2:-Requirements#1114-removing-information-from-an-account)
   5.  [1.1.1.5](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group6/wiki/D2:-Requirements#1115-deleting-an-account)
   6.  [1.1.1.6](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group6/wiki/D2:-Requirements#1116-logging-inlogging-out)
2. Creating API documents for the endpoints for the use of frontend and mobile teams
   1. registration
   2. login
   3. logout
3. Creating and linking issues for the tracking of milestone I deliverables
4. Taking and uploading notes for
   1. General meeting #2
   2. General meeting #4
   3. Backend meeting #3

### Code Related Responsibilities
1. Implementing registration functionality
2. Implementing login functionality
3. Implementing logout functionality
4. Deploying the app to the AWS instance - *shared responsibility*

## Main Contributions
Overall, I believe I contributed to both how we manage the deployment and the code significantly.

My contributions to the management range from more significant things like reviewing a part of the requirements and creating API documents, to less significant things like general upkeep of the wiki (by fixing many things wherever and whenever I see them) and keeping track of the discussions during the meetings to ensure that we as a group do not sidetrack from the agenda.

My contribution to the code includes both solo and shared tasks. The solo tasks were where I implemented registration, login and logout on the backend side. The shared tasks were deciding on the directory structure of the backend side with [Artun](https://github.com/artun-akdogan) and deploying the app to the AWS instance with [Artun](https://github.com/artun-akdogan), [Ali Kaan](https://github.com/Aliqaan), [Bedirhan](https://github.com/BPamukcuoglu), [Aral](https://github.com/araldortogul), and [Berfin](https://github.com/berfinsimsekk). In addition, I helped deploy the version that will be used in the demo with [Hakan](https://github.com/LehabuL) and [Artun](https://github.com/artun-akdogan).

In total, I am involved in 23 issues so far either by being the author of it, assignee of it, or commenting on it.

  * Unfortunately, I did not create a separate issue for writing the API doc because I decided to write one after I implemented the registration feature.
* [#213 Creating API Documentation for Login](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group6/issues/213)
* [#222 Creating API Documentation for Logout](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group6/issues/222)

* [#223 Logout Feature Completion](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group6/pull/223)

## Additional Information

In general, I tried my best to be consistent about my fingerprint on the management system and the wiki. You can see that the style and form of my issues, pull requests, comments, commit messages, and page edit notes are all consistent within themselves. I believe by doing so, one can find what they are looking for in my contribution much more faster and easier because it takes less effort to search and to reach something in a consistent pattern.

I also tended to the wiki very frequently, and fixed numerous things such as typos whenever I found them.

    I am working as a Frontend developer in the Frontend team of Group 6.

    **Responsibilities:**

   As a team, we started the new term by revising our wiki page and requirements. I updated and edited README.md, deliverables and meeting notes in the first week. After cleaning up our wiki, we spent some time on requirements. I reviewed "voting a post" and "Interactions Between the Users and the Comments" requirements with İrem.
   
   After dividing into subgroups as Mobile, Backend and Frontend, I decided to be on the frontend team. I was responsible for creating a profile and a register page. Since I was not familiar with React.js, I spent some time on practicing it. After looking some example pages, I have created profile and register page for our app.
   
   Finally, I have updated the project plan with Aral according to our new arrangements.
