    **Member:**
    
    I am working as a UI/UX developer in the Mobile team of Group 6.

    **Responsibilities:**

    Last semester, we have worked on preparing the requirements for our project Medishare. Before diving into the implementation, my group and I have reviewed the requirements and updated them according to the new customer's demands. We have also reviewed the mockups and scenarios so that they are in line with the requirements. Then, we have divided the group into three teams: Mobile, Frontend, and Backend, and I assigned myself to the mobile team.
    
    As a mobile developer, I was responsible for initializing the mobile application and implementing the most fundamental features until this milestone with my team. First of all, we have researched about the popular frameworks that are used in mobile development, and decided to use React Native for this purpose. I have not worked with React Native before, so it took a while for me to set up my working environment and get used to developing with this new framework.

    For this milestone, I have implemented the main navigation of the mobile application, the user profile page, and a page for editing the user profile. Moreover, I have supported my team in the deployment of the application.

    Last but not least, I have updated the project plan with Berfin, which is important in terms of the overall project management.
