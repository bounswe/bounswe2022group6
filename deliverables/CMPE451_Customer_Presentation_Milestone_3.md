# CMPE451 Customer Presentation Milestone 3

# Group Milestone Report

## Executive Summary

### Summary of Project Status

Following the customer milestone 2 demo, we have identified the final features that we wish to add to the application, and ordered them by their importance and urgency given that we have 2 weeks to the final demo. We have identified 3 primary tasks. These were;

* Implementing annotation support
* Implementing semantic search using an ontology
* Getting the web and mobile applications to have the same capabilities

Right after identifying these task, we divided the relevant parts of them in each subgroup and began working on them. Each subgroup assigned the relevant parts of the tasks above to their members and began working on them. At the end of the 2 week period, we have completed two of the three tasks. Before the final demo, we have synchronized the development status of the mobile and web apps, and implemented W3C standard compliant annotation support. In addition, we tied up the loose ends of the features implemented during the last milestone preparation.

Overall, we have implemented the following features;

* Registration and account management
* Content Creation
  * Creating, editing and deleting posts and comments
  * Labeling posts
* Reputation System
  * Upvoting and downvoting posts and comments
* Annotation Support
  * Text and image annotations
* Keyword and label based search
* Basic chatbot support
  * Using decision trees

### Status of the Deliverables

### Final Release Notes

1. The web application is now fully functional. It has all the features that the mobile application has, and it is fully integrated with the backend.
2. The web application now supports text and image annotations on posts and comments.
3. The mobile application now supports text annotations on posts and comments.
4. Annotations are now W3C standard compliant and kept in their own database.
5. It is now possible to edit posts and comments.
6. Chatbot has been improved to display previous replies of the user.

### Changes Made and Planned from Previous Milestone

Apart from the details of what needs to implemented, we have decided to ensure a more communicative development process to speed up the development of features that require a high degree of colloboration, such as the annotation support. Unlike before, the assignees of such tasks got together after the general meetings to decide on the details of the implementation and to ensure that the implementation is done in a way that is compatible with the rest of the application. This has resulted in a more efficient development process.

### Reflections from Final Milestone Demo

Although unfortunately we have not met all the criteria we hoped to satisfy, we have managed to implement the most important features of the application. Although we have implemented numerous features in the two week period, we believe that our presentation was enough to showcase them clearly. Because our presentation was easy to follow, there has been a very few questions and we were able to answer them quickly. We believe that this was a good sign that our presentation was clear and concise. In addition, we have discussed about how the presentation could be improved and concluded that practicing it more would have been beneficial.

### What Could be Done Differently?

One of the biggest problems we faced was the tracking of the tasks that were assigned. The tracking of the tasks assigned to each member was not done as well as it could have been. This resulted in some members not being able to complete their tasks in time. To change this, several measures about what should be done when a member did not complete their tasks in time should have been taken. For example, the tasks that were not completed in time should have been reassigned to other members, or the tasks should have been split into smaller tasks. Ideally, we believe that these measures would solve the challenges we faced. Although we have discussed these solutions at the start of the project, given the nature of the course and the lack of hierarchy between the students to enforce the rules we discussed, realizing these solutions was not possible.

What could be done instead, was to request help from the teaching assistants and the course instructor. This way, we could benefit from their experiences about such challenges, and they could point us in a better direction to solve the problems we faced.

Apart from the management issues we faced, we could also revise how we prioritize the tasks. Rather than giving a higher priority to implementing very refined versions of the features, we could have given a higher priority to implementing the features in a more basic form. This way, we could have implemented more features in the time we had.
