## **Member:** [Yusuf Erdem Nacar](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group6/wiki/Yusuf-Erdem-Nacar), Group 6 - Backend.

As a member of the backend subteam, I was mainly responsible for developing the support for the functionalities and database model classes for the core parts of the project such as posts, comments, labels, accounts, search, and annotations.

In detail, I was tasked with laying the groundwork for the backend support for many of the functionalities of the app. This includes creating model classes for the contents, posts, comments and labels. In addition to preparing the mentioned model classes, I also implemented numerous endpoints for the core functionalities of the application, such as user management using token authentication, database support for the content in the application using django models, search functionality that makes keyword and label based searhes, and annotation functionality that allows users to annotate the contents of the application.

### **Additional Information:**

In general, I tried my best to be consistent about my what I hove throughout the development of the application. All of my work, including issues, code, pull requests, tests, commit messages, etc. are very consistent within themselves and it makes them very easy to understand and track. This also helps my teammates and the development process overall, because a person whose work depends on mine could easily track the changes I implemented without needing to communicate with me.

Additionally, I have been very careful about my responsibilities deadlines. Almost all, if not all, of my responsibilities are completed before their respective deadlines. This is also very important for the development process, because it helps my teammates to plan their work accordingly.

In addition, I have also tried my best to determine and solve the problems with the management of the development, such as past deadlines and lack of communication. At numerous times I filled in the work that was blocking other people's work and was not being worked on, to best of my ability, even though it was not my responsibility.

Overall, I have tried my best to be a good teammate and abide by the good practices of software project management, and I believe that I have been successful in this regard.

     **Member:**
   [Berfin Şimşek](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group6/wiki/Berfin-%C5%9Eim%C5%9Fek)
    
    I am working as a Frontend developer in the Frontend team of Group 6.

    **Responsibilities:**

   As a team, we started the new term by revising our wiki page and requirements. I updated and edited README.md, deliverables and meeting notes in the first week. After cleaning up our wiki, we spent some time on requirements. I reviewed "voting a post" and "Interactions Between the Users and the Comments" requirements with İrem.
   
   After dividing into subgroups as Mobile, Backend and Frontend, I decided to be on the frontend team. Until the first milestone, I was responsible for creating a profile and a register page. Since I was not familiar with React.js, I spent some time on practicing it. After looking some example pages, I have created profile and register page for our app.
   
   Finally, I have updated the project plan with Aral according to our new arrangements.

    For milestone 2, my main responsibility was implementing the necessary functions and integrating backend endpoints to the profile page of the user. I integrated GET and POST methods of the profile page so that user can see her account information and edit them if necessary. Also I changed the design of the page so that if the user is a doctor, she should form another form for vericifation by giving diploma ID and profession. I added a message to indicate the user whether verification process is completed or not. 

    Additionally, I was responsible of the page's general design and compatilibity with other pages in terms of styling.

    I modified the messages that appear after an operation such as "Login successful" so that they disappear 3 seconds after showing the message.

    I also updated the project plan with Aral according to work done by each member.
    
    For the final milestone, I was responsible for the chatbot, verified doctors' usernames and post edit functionality.
    
    First of all, I added a chatbot on our homepage by using react-simple-chatbot library. I made the questions and the options that user can choose compatible with our mobile chatbot.
    
    After that, I added a stethoscope emoji next to the verified doctors' usernames. Thus, other users can distinguish doctors' posts or comments from others.
    
    Finally, I integrated backend endpoint for editing a post. A user can edit her post's title or description via the edit button that is integrated with backend.
  
   
    **Main Contributions:** 
    
    - Reviewed requirements
    - Profile page design and implementation
    - Register page design and implementation
    - Integrated backend endpoints for getting a user's account information
    - Integrated backend endpoints for editing a user's account information
    - Designed the profile page
    - Added a form to profile page for doctor verification
    - Updated project plan
    - Chatbot for frontend
    - Doctors' username are distinguished from others by an emoji
    - Integrated backend endpoint for editing a post
