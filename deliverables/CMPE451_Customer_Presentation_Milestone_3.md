     **Member:**
   [Berfin Şimşek](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group6/wiki/Berfin-%C5%9Eim%C5%9Fek)
    
    I am working as a Frontend developer in the Frontend team of Group 6.

    **Responsibilities:**

   As a team, we started the new term by revising our wiki page and requirements. I updated and edited README.md, deliverables and meeting notes in the first week. After cleaning up our wiki, we spent some time on requirements. I reviewed "voting a post" and "Interactions Between the Users and the Comments" requirements with İrem.
   
   After dividing into subgroups as Mobile, Backend and Frontend, I decided to be on the frontend team. Until the first milestone, I was responsible for creating a profile and a register page. Since I was not familiar with React.js, I spent some time on practicing it. After looking some example pages, I have created profile and register page for our app.
   
   Finally, I have updated the project plan with Aral according to our new arrangements.

    For milestone 2, my main responsibility was implementing the necessary functions and integrating backend endpoints to the profile page of the user. I integrated GET and POST methods of the profile page so that user can see her account information and edit them if necessary. Also I changed the design of the page so that if the user is a doctor, she should form another form for vericifation by giving diploma ID and profession. I added a message to indicate the user whether verification process is completed or not. 

    Additionally, I was responsible of the page's general design and compatilibity with other pages in terms of styling.

    I modified the messages that appear after an operation such as "Login successful" so that they disappear 3 seconds after showing the message.

    I also updated the project plan with Aral according to work done by each member.
    
    For the final milestone, I was responsible for the chatbot, verified doctors' usernames and post edit functionality.
    
    First of all, I added a chatbot on our homepage by using react-simple-chatbot library. I made the questions and the options that user can choose compatible with our mobile chatbot.
    
    After that, I added a stethoscope emoji next to the verified doctors' usernames. Thus, other users can distinguish doctors' posts or comments from others.
    
    Finally, I integrated backend endpoint for editing a post. A user can edit her post's title or description via the edit button that is integrated with backend.
